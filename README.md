# genetics
Simulates changes in phenotypes and genotypes over generations.

To do:
- Create Gene class
    - Needs to hold info for how it changes survival rate and sexual selection as simple % modifiers
    - Gene linkage, simulating genes nearby on same chromosome by tying frequencies together
- Create text files that get read and processed to set up species and their genes + initial frequencies
